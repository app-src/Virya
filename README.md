# Virya

A mobile app designed to help users accurately practice yoga.

#### Why Virya?
Yoga is beneficial when practised in the proper order and positions; otherwise, it would do more harm than good to the person.

Who's got time to go to expenive yoga classes. What's better than a personal yoga trainer app in their mobile itself.

#### What is Virya?
Virya is a mobile application which uses Android ML Kit to detect pose of users using mobile cameras. Then guide them to perform yoga in the best way possible. We are matching the angles for detectig the accuracy of the yoga positions users are perpforming.There are several applications available to track your workouts, but no one uses machine learning to let consumers know if they are doing it correctly.
